# docker.service-base
Base Docker Image for Services.

**THE MASTER BRANCH DOESN'T CONTAIN ANY DOCKERFILE**

If you want to see the source of an Image you need to switch to the branch with the same name as the tag of the Image.

E.g. the Dockerfile of the image `docker.service-base:java` can be found in the [java](https://github.com/synoa/docker.service-base/tree/java) branch.
